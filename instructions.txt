ex 1. moving the data to where it needs to be
	A. start with sales.vue, you'll find most of the file is already built out for you populate the FE elements with data from the prop
	B. move on to consultants.vue, for this component you'll need to add an object to callbox.vue and pass it throuogh to consultants as a prop 
	C. finally on to support.vue, here you'll have the opportunity to built your own component completely from scratch. try not to copy annd paste one of the other examples

ex 2. displaying things where they're needed
	A. note the buttons at the top of callbox.vue, lets add some of vue's @click functions to them
	B. simliarly to how dev is displayed, we'll use a datapoint in local state to determine what we want to display

ex 3. lifecycle
	A. take a look at the devs component, note the created and destroyed functions , open the console and toggle the dev button a few times, the lifecycle methods should fire
	B. Vue has several lifecycle methods: beforeCreate, created, beforeMount, mounted, beforeUpdate, updated, beforeDestrory, and destroyed try adding a lifecycle method to one of the other components
